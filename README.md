Custom user and email authentication django app with Stripe payments/subscription


During this little project I have learned how to:

- Setup a new derived version of the user model
- Change the authentication backend system
- Know how to register new users using the new method of authentication
- Understand the steps involved in logging into Django
- Log a user out

Lesson Challenges completed on 24/06/2016
- Show only login and register links if an user is not logged in and show only Logout link if a user is logged in
- Show the users last_login in the profile page

Stripe unique payment added 25/6/16
- Added Stripe env in settings.py
- Created registration age that ask for a payment through Stripe
